- Business Logic
- It encapsulates the application's business logic, controlling transactions and coor-dinating responses in the implementation of its operations.

- A repository is a separation between a domain and a persistent layer.
- Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.
